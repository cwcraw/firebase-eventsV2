## Event Tracker Web App backend End

This backend allows the user to create, edit and Delete events. This front end is made with node.js and designed to be hosted on firebase. The frontend I used can be found [here](https://github.com/cwcraw/eventsv2-fe) and is hosted on heroku.


### Details
I referred to this [guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-todo-application-using-reactjs-and-firebase/) for making this backend, as I had not worked with firebase before, but wanted to explore its user authentication capabilities. If you try to follow my code please note that I have not included my firebase config file in this repository. You will need to place a config.js file in the util folder. This file will contain your firebase SD snippet JSON object.
